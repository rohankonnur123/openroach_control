# openroach_control

As a part of the Biomimetic Millisystems lab at UC Berkeley, my goal was to use Beacon sensors connected to an Arduino board to build higher resolution spatial awareness for the OpenRoach robot platform. This spatial awareness would translate to a more efficient control scheme. 

The OpenRoach platform is a bug robot platform. The labs goal is to create a self-repairing robot. The control scheme I develop would be used to better locate the repair station when the robot determines that it is not fully operative. 

This project has required use of Mbed Online Compiler to load the code onto the board. The robot itself was prebuilt.
